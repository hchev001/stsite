title: WISTPC 2014 - 1
subtitle: Workshop on Integrating Software Testing into Programming Courses
---

**Date**: March 5, 2014

**Description**:

The WISTPC workshop introduces participants to a minimally intrusive approach to integrating software testing into software engineering and advance programming courses using a cyber-learning environment. The focus of the workshop will be to introduce participants to (1) software testing techniques, and (2) the features of WReSTT – Web-Based Repository of Software Testing Tutorials, that supports testing in the classroom. WReSTT integrates aspects of collaborative learning and social networking to improve students’ ability to learn software testing techniques and testing tools. We expect participants to know Java and we assume they have little or no formal training in software testing. At the end of the workshop participants should: (1) have a basic understanding of software testing and testing tools, (2) be able to use WReSTT in their classes, and (3) be able to use learning objects to support software testing instruction. Laptop Required – a web browser and WiFi enabled.
