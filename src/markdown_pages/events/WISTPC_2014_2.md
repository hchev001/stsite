**Date**: July 18th & 19th, 2014

**Location**: Florida International University, Miami FL, 33199

**Schedule**: Download Schedule

**Description**:

We are seeking instructors of courses with significant programming content to attend the Fifth Workshop on Integrating Software Testing into Programming Courses (WISTPC 2014:2). The focus of WISTPC 2014:2 will be to introduce instructors to: (1) software testing techniques and concepts, (2) the features of WReSTT - Web-based Repository of Software Testing Tutorials, and (3) approaches to integrate software testing into existing courses. WReSTT is a cyberlearning environment that integrates aspects of collaborative learning, social networking and gamification to increase students' participation in using the available learning materials on software testing, and improve their software testing skills.

**Objectives**:

- Provide a forum where CS/IT instructors can improve their knowledge of software testing and software testing tools to support pedagogy.
- Learn how to use WReSTT in the classroom, including the collaborative learning, social networking and gamification features.
- Explore pedagogical techniques that can be used to integrate software testing into existing courses using the features and learning materials provided by WReSTT.

**Benefits**:

- Participants will increase their knowledge of software testing and the use of software testing tools to support instruction in courses with significant programming
- Participants will be able to access the tools and learning materials hosted in WReSTT and be able to use the features of WReSTT to support pedagogy.
- Participants will have developed plans to integrate software testing into existing courses thereby improving students' knowledge of software testing and software testing skills.

**Support**:

The workshop is supported by an NSF TUES II grant and we have funds to support travel and lodging for a limited number of persons to attend the workshop. If you are supported by the grant to attend the workshop, we expect that in Fall 2014 and subsequent semesters you will perform studies to help us determine the impact of using WReSTT in the classroom.

Participants are required to bring laptops.
