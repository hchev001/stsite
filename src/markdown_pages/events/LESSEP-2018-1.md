**Eligibility:** Instructors of CS1, CS2, Software Engineering and Software Testing courses.

**Flyer:** [LESSEP-18-1-Flyer](./lessep-2018-1/files/LESSEP-2018-CFP-030918.pdf)

**Schedule:** [LESSEP-18-1-Schedule](./lessep-2018-1/files/Draft-Workshop-Schedule-Attendees-060318.pdf)

**Workshop Focus:**

- Introduce instructors to the features of SEP-CyLE – Software Engineering and Programming Cyberlearning Environment that supports student learning.
- Introduce instructors to various learning and engagement strategies (LESs), e.g., collaborative learning, social interaction, gamification, and problem based learning.
- Form a community of instructors that contributes to the development of learning objects (LOs) for Software Engineering and Programming (SEP) courses.

**Benefits:**

- Quickly and easily integrate the use of SEP-CyLE into the course activities for CS/IT/SE courses.
- Use the LESs in SEP-CyLE to improve student learning in CS/IT/SE courses.
- Be part of a community that uses and contributes to the development of learning objects for SEP courses.

**Support:**

The workshop is supported by an NSF IUSE Engaged Student Learning - Design and Development Level II grant (DUE-1525112). We have funds to support travel and lodging for a limited number of persons to attend the workshop.
