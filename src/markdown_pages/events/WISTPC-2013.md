title: WISTPC 2013
subtitle: Workshop on Integrating Software Testing into Programming Courses
---

The NSF supported workshop on Integrating Software Testing into Programming Courses (WISTPC-13) is hosted by Florida International University (FIU) and will be located at FIU on July 12th and 13th, 2013.

**Objectives**:

- Provide a forum where CS/IT instructors can improve their knowledge of software testing and software testing tools to support pedagogy.
- Learn to use WReSTT in the classroom and its various features, including the collaborative learning and learning objects features.
- Explore pedagogical techniques to use WReSTT and its collaborative learning and learning objects features to increase student learning about testing.

**Benefits**:

- Participants of the workshop will increase their knowledge of software testing and the use of software testing tools to support instruction in courses with significant programming.
- Participants of the workshop will be able to access the tools and learning materials hosted in WReSTT and be able to use the features of WReSTT to support pedagogy.
- Participants will have developed plans for use of WReSTT and related features to improve student learning about testing.

**Support**:

The workshop is supported by an NSF TUES 2 grant and we have funds to support travel and lodging for a limited number of persons to attend the workshop. If we support you to attend the workshop we expect that in Fall 2013 and subsequent semesters you will perform studies to help us determine the impact of using WReSTT in the classroom.
