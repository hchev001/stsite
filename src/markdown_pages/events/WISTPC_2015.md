title: WISTPC 2015
subtitle: Workshop on Integrating Software Testing into Programming Courses
---

**Date**: June 12-13

**Location**: Florida International University

**Flyer**: WISTPC-15-Flyer

**Schedule**: WISTPC-15-Schedule

**Description**:

We are seeking instructors of courses with significant programming content to attend the Sixth Workshop on Integrating Software Testing into Programming Courses (WISTPC2015:1). The focus of WISTPC 2015 will be to introduce instructors to: (1) software testing techniques and concepts, (2) the features of WReSTT - Web-based Repository of Software Testing Tutorials, and (3) approaches to integrate software testing into existing courses. WReSTT is a cyberlearning environment that integrates aspects of collaborative learning, social networking and gamification to increase students' participation in using the available learning materials on software testing, and improve their software testing skills.

**Objectives**:

- Provide a forum where CS/IT instructors can improve their knowledge of software testing and software testing tools to support pedagogy.
- Learn how to use WReSTT in the classroom, including the collaborative learning, social networking and gamification features.
- Explore pedagogical techniques that can be used to integrate software testing into existing courses using the features and learning materials provided by WReSTT.

**Benefits**

At the end of the workshop, participants will have:

- Increased knowledge of software testing and the use of software testing tools to support instruction in courses with significant programming.
- Access the learning materials hosted in WReSTT and be able to use the features of WReSTT to support pedagogy.
- A concrete plan of action and materials to integrate software testing into their existing courses thereby improving students’ knowledge of software testing and software testing skills.

**Support**:

The workshop is supported by an NSF TUES II grant and we have funds to support travel and lodging for a limited number of persons to attend the workshop. If you are supported by the grant to attend the workshop, we expect that in Fall 2015 and subsequent semesters you will perform studies to help us determine the impact of using WReSTT in the classroom.
