title: LESSEP 2017 - 1
subtitle: Second Workshop on Using Learning and Engagement Strategies in Software Engineering and Programming Courses
---

**Date**: June 2 & June 3, 2017

**Location**: <a href="https://www.fiu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Florida International University</a>, Miami, FL, USA

**Eligibility**: Instructors of CS1, CS2, Software Engineering and Software Testing courses.

**Schedule**: [LESSEP-17-1-Schedule](./LESSEP-2017-1/files/LESSEP-2017-1Workshop-Schedule.pdf)

**Workshop Focus**:

- Introduce instructors to various learning and engagement strategies (LESs), e.g., collaborative learning, social interaction, gamification, and problem based learning.
- Introduce instructors to the features of SEP-CyLE – Software Engineering and Programming Cyberlearning Environment that supports student learning.
- Form a community of instructors that contributes to the development of learning objects (LOs) for Software Engineering and Programming (SEP) courses.

**Benefits**:

- Increased knowledge of LESs and how they can be used to improve student learning in SEP courses.
- Access the learning materials in SEP-CyLE and be able to use the features of SEP-CyLE to support pedagogy.
- Be part of a community that uses and contributes to the development of learning objects for SEP courses.
- Be able to conduct experimental studies to determine the impact using LESs and SEP-CyLE will have on student learning and share these results with the CS education community

**Support**:

The workshop is supported by an NSF IUSE Engaged Student Learning - Design and Development Level II grant (DUE-1525112). We have funds to support travel and lodging for a limited number of persons to attend the workshop.
